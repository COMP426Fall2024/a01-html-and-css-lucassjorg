            <li>Egypt
                <p class = "par">Many historians argue the first known examples of the phoenix come from Ancient Egypt.  This version was known as Bennu, a bird-like diety who is linked with the sun and is said to have played a role in the creation of the world, as well as being a part of the soul of the sun diety Ra.  Being self-created, this Ancient Egyptian diety may have been the inspiration fofr the phoenix in Greek Mythology we commonly know.</p>
             </li>
            <li>Greece
                <p class = "par">The phoenix is most widely known in Greek mythology, and its introduction has been credited to the historian Herodotus.  He acknowledged the Egyptian stories and described the bird as living for at least 500 years before igniting itself in Heliopolis and being reborn from the ashes. Only one phoenix existed at a time. </p>
            </li>
            <li>Persia
                <p class = "par">The mythical bird in Persian mythology was known as Simurgh. Similar to the other examples, this bird was magical and benevolent, with a supposed life cycle of 1,700 years.  It is known to have saved the life of prince Zal in the Shahnama.</p>
            </li>
            <li>China
                <p class = "par">The Chinese version of the phoenix is the Fenghuang. According to mythology, it was made up of the "beak of a rooster, the face of a swallow, the forehead of a fowl, the neck of a snake, the breast of a goose, the back of a tortoise, the hindquarters of a stag and the tail of a fish." Different than in other cultures, this bird had no distinct gender, its body was symbolic of celestial bodies and the duality of yin and yang. </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        Throughout history, the phoenix has been a symbol of hope and perserverence due to its ability to resurrect and rise from its own ashes.  The bird is representative of the cyclical nature of life and death that exists for all living things. 
        Today, the mythical bird continues to inspire through stories in literature, art, and popular culture. It reminds us of the nearly infinite human endurance and the fact that we can always be reinvented and start anew.
